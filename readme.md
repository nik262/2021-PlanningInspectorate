## Background
### Context
This project was created to optimise the workflow of the Planning Inspectorate group when consulting the relevant organisations on planning permission. The project involves a web app that connects to a backend that can perform various relevant processes more efficiently than was previously possible. Examples of this are automatically parsing and processing Excel files and maintaining a master database of consultees.

### User Stories
* When a new building is to be developed the planning inspectorate need to authorise it. This requires permission from all goverment bodies within a 15 mile radius. The list of consultees is prepared by uploading a shape file to GIS software which compares it against datasets and outputs the relavent data in a spreadsheet. This then requires a series of manual applicability tests to be applied from the legal regulations to complete the consultation list.

* The time it takes to manually compile consultation lists during pre-application and to conduct/monitor the consultation process. Therefore an automated solution that refreshes and enhances the EST GIS consultation tool and reduce the time taken to identify relevant consultation bodies for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) and compile consultation body lists would be of great convenice.
