## Planning inspectorate project

Tech Stack:
- MySQL database
- Spring Boot backend 
- React frontend


## User Stories:

When a new building is to be developed the planning inspectorate need to authorise it. This requires permission from all goverment bodies within a 15 mile radius. The list of consultees is prepared by uploading a shape file to GIS software which compares it against datasets and outputs the relavent data in a spreadsheet. This then requires a series of manual applicability tests to be applied from the legal regulations to complete the consultation list.

The time it takes to manually compile consultation lists during pre-application and to conduct/monitor the consultation process. Therefore an automated solution that refreshes and enhances the EST GIS consultation tool and reduce the time taken to identify relevant consultation bodies for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) and compile consultation body lists would be of great convenice. 

## Website design flowchart:
Below is a flow chart detailing all the different pages of the website. Each of the pages has a mockup of how it should look and a feature list, see below. Each of the pages also has a list in the kanban board where all of the identified features are added as issues for the team to work on.
