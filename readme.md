## User Stories:

When a new building is to be developed the planning inspectorate need to authorise it. This requires permission from all goverment bodies within a 15 mile radius. The list of consultees is prepared by uploading a shape file to GIS software which compares it against datasets and outputs the relavent data in a spreadsheet. This then requires a series of manual applicability tests to be applied from the legal regulations to complete the consultation list.

The time it takes to manually compile consultation lists during pre-application and to conduct/monitor the consultation process. Therefore an automated solution that refreshes and enhances the EST GIS consultation tool and reduce the time taken to identify relevant consultation bodies for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) and compile consultation body lists would be of great convenice.
